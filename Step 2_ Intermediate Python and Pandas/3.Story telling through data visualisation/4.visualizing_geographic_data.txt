1. Geographic Data
  > From scientific fields like meteorology and climatology, through to the software on our smartphones like Google Maps and Facebook 
    check-ins, geographic data is always present in our everyday lives.
  > To explore this kind of data, you'll need to learn how to visualize the data on maps.


2.Geographic Coordinate System
  > A geographic coordinate system allows us to locate any point on Earth using latitude and longitude coordinates.
  > Latitude and longitude values describe points on a sphere, which is three-dimensional. 
    To plot the values on a two-dimensional plane, we need to convert the coordinates to the Cartesian coordinate system 
     using a map projection.
  > A map projection transforms points on a sphere to a two-dimensional plane. 
   When projecting down to the two-dimensional plane, some properties are distorted. Each map projection makes trade-offs in 
   what properties to preserve. We'll use the Mercator projection, because it is commonly used by popular mapping software.

3. Installing Basemap
  >  Basemap is an extension to Matplotlib that makes it easier to work with geographic data. 
  > The matplotlib basemap toolkit is a library for plotting 2D data on maps in Python
  > conda install basemap
    conda install -c conda-forge basemap (from linux kernel)
 
4. Workflow with Basemap
   > Create a new basemap instance with the specific map projection we want to use and how much of the map we want included.
    Convert spherical coordinates to Cartesian coordinates using the basemap instance.
    Use the matplotlib and basemap methods to customize the map.
    Display the map.
