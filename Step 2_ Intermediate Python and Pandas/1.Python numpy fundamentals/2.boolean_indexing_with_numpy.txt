1. Reading CSV files with Numpy
  > np.genfromtxt(filename, delimiter=None,skip) to read files from ndarrays
  > we can pass an additional parameter, skip_header, to the numpy.genfromtxt() function. The skip_header parameter accepts an integer, 
    the number of rows from the start of the file to skip.
  > NumPy ndarrays can contain only one datatype.
  > when numpy.genfromtxt() reads in a file, it attempts to determine the data type of the file by looking at the values,
   so no explicit type conversion
  > We can use the ndarray.dtype attribute to see the internal datatype that has been used 

2. Boolean Arrays
  >  A boolean array, as the name suggests, is an array of boolean values. Boolean arrays are sometimes 
    called boolean vectors or boolean masks.
  > Create boolean arrays using vectorized boolean operations. Next,index (or select) using boolean arrays, known as boolean indexing.

3. Boolean indexing with 1-D ndarrays
  > The boolean array acts as a filter, so that the values corresponding to True become part of the result 
    and the values corresponding to False are removed.
    bool_index=np.array[]<something, array[bool_index]

4. Boolean indexing with 2D ndarrays
   > The only limitation is that the boolean array must have the same length as the dimension you're indexing.
   > Because a boolean array contains no information about how it was created, 
     we can use a boolean array made from just one column of our array to index the whole array.
   
5. Assigning Values in ndarrays
   > ndarray[location_of_values] = new_value
   
6. Assignment using Boolean Arrays
  > The boolean array controls the values that the assignment applies to, and the other values remain unchanged.
  > array[bool_array]= assigned_value


 In this mission we learned:

 1) How to use numpy.genfromtxt() to read in an ndarray.
 2) About NaN values.
 3) What a boolean array is, and how to create one.
 4) How to use boolean indexing to filter values in one and two-dimensional ndarrays.
 5) How to assign one or more new values to an ndarray based on their locations.
 6) How to assign one or more new values to an ndarray based on their values.
