1. Data munging
   >  Data munging involves transforming datasets to make them easier to work with. 
      Some datasets are too large to load into Python, so looking at them or transforming them beforehand can be useful. 
      Even for smaller datasets, simple exploration on the command line is faster than exploration in Python, 
      and file-based tasks like unifying datasets can be faster on the command line.
  
2. Data exploration
   > head n no_of_line filename
   > tail n no_lines filename

3. Filtering
   > connecting all files into one
     head -1 filename1 > singlefile
     wc -l filename1
     tail -no_of_lines filename1 >> singlefile

4. consolidating datasets
   > add all data sets in one file as above
     head -1 filename2 > singlefile
     wc -l filename2
     tail -no_of_lines filename2 >> singlefile

5. counting
   > count no of lines 
     eg- grep '1980-1989' combined_hud.csv | wc -l , counts no of lines containg 1980-1989
