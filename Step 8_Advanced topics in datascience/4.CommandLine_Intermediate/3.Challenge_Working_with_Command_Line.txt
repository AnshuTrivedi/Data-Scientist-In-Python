1. Introduction
  > Here's a rough outline of the steps in this exercise:
   Create a Python script.
   Create a virtual environment.
   Change file permissions.
   Execute a Python script from the command line.
 
  1) Change out of the current directory, then back in.
     cd ..
     cd -
  2) Print the path of the current folder to the standard output.
     pwd

2. Create a script
   1) Create a Python script that takes in a command line argument and prints it out.
       echo -e 'import sys\n\nif __name__ == "__main__":\n    print(sys.argv[1])' > script.py

3. Change file Permissions
    Edit the file permissions for script.py so that only the current user can access it.
   1) Assign read, write, and execute permissions to the current user.
      chmod 0700 script.py or
      chmod u=rwx script.py  or
      chmod u=rwx,g=---,o=---  filename (both operations together)
   2) Don't assign any permissions to your group, or to other users.
      chmod 0700 script.py
      chmod go-rwx script.py

4. Create virtual environment
    1) Create a Python 3 virtualenv called script.
       virtualenv -p /user/bin/python3 script
    2) Activate the script virtualenv.
       source script/bin/activate

5. Move the script
   1) Create a folder called printer in the current user's home directory (/home/dq/).
       mkdir printer
   2) Move script.py into the printer folder.
      mv script.py printer

6. Execute script
   1) Change the current directory to the printer directory.
      cd printer
   2) Execute script.py, and pass in the string I'm so good at challenges!.
      python script.py "I'm so good at challenges!"
      or
      echo "I'm so good at challenges!" > script.py
      python script.py
