# Note:
 I have mentioned link of jupyter notebook files of course parts mentioned as 1,2,3 and so on.All below mentioned course parts also have</br>
 plain text notes and very short notes in pdf format starting with same name as jupyter notebook.So ,if interested to see</br> 
 pdf takeaways and plain text notes,kindly go to folders.
