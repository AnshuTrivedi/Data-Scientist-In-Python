1. Types of commands
   > Some programs — specifically those that run with their own executable file — are commands
   > file: Usually refered to as program, utility, tool, or sometimes just command, these are simply executable files 
    (analogous to Windows' files whose extension is exe).

   > builtin: Usually refered to as a command or built-in command. Built-in commands are always available in RAM 
    (a special kind of computer memory that is very fast to access, contrary to hard drives).
    They run quickly and are always available, which is useful when we need to troubleshoot problems in the system.

  > alias: This is just a different name for a command. We usually use aliases to abbreviate frequently used commands.

  > function: A function here is similar to what you learned in Python, only it is in a different language (namely the shell 
    language that we happen to be using).

  > keyword: Keywords are words reserved for specific things and shouldn't be used for other purposes (like being aliases). 
   We'll become more familiar with them when we learn about programming in the shell

 > To figure out a command's type, we can use the type command: eg - type command_name 
 
 
2. Aliases,Functions and keywords
  > Commands and features that aren't POSIX compliant and are available in Bash are called bashisms
  > declare -F : tells if command is function
  > We can also use compgen to list all aliases, all built-in commands, all keywords, etc.
    compgen -k
 > compgen : generate completions for partial name
 > alias alias_name=command , eg- alias d=date
 > unalias alias_name , eg- unalias d
 
 > To use man to access documentation, we can run man <utility>, where <utility> is a placeholder for the program 
   whose documentation we wish to see. This command will display the documentation in an interactive program called less. 
   The displayed document is usually called the man page.

 > We use man to access the documentation of programs.
   We use help to access the documentation of built-in commands (in Bash).

3. Reading synopsis
  >  A terminal pager is a program used to view the contents of a text file by navigating it page by page (or line by line).
  > Access the manual of an executable file: man command.
  > Access the manual of a built-in command: help command.
  > See the contents of a file with less: less filename.
  > See the contents of a file with less without wraping lines: less -S filename.
