1. > when we'll want to save this output in another file. Known as output redirection,
    we'll redirect the output from the screen to files.
 
2. Redirecting output with >
  > command > flename (echo Hi Anshu > first_redirection)
  > The redirection operator > will:
      Empty the contents of the target file when it is invoked, if the file exists.
      If it doesn't exist, it will create it.
  > -h option in grep, which allows us to exclude the filenames from the output.

3. Redirecting output with >>
  >  Whereas > always creates a new file, >> appends to the target file, if the target file exists,
     otherwise it creates a new file. 
  > output >> filename
 
4. Creating empty files
   > Can create file using echo but it is non empty file or another way is (echo -n " " >file_name) it creates empty file
   > touch command creates empty files
   > If the files exist, it will alter their last modification time, otherwise it will create empty files with the arguments' name.

5. Why pipelines
  > Accessing specific columns and then selecting specific rows required two commands and accessing the hard drive for reading and writing. 
    This can be very inefficient when working with large datasets:
      1) It can be slow because we access the hard drive, which is slower than accessing RAM.
      2) It occupies disk space unnecessarily, and disk space costs money.

6. Using pipelines
   > We can connect the output of command1 to the input of command2 by running command1 | command2. 
     The vertical bar (|) is called a pipe and it is responsible for "piping" the output of the first
     command into the input of the second command.

7.The unix philosophy
  > An additional feature of the shell is that it allows us to use as many pipes as we want, 
   making it easy to combine the capabilities of several programs. 
   This feature is at the core of the Unix philosophy
  > Some of the benefits of this are:
    1) Makes it unnecessary to write big programs that accomplish only one goal, 
       by virtue of the fruitfulness of combining already existing commands.
    2) It empowers the users to create more complex commands by virtue of the existing programs.
    3) The smaller programs are actually useful on their own, and not just as part of a whole.

8. Trying to redirect errors
  > /dev/null is a special file used to discard data. Any data redirected to this file will be ignored
    by the operating system and simply disappear.
  > This is useful when a command performs an action and outputs something, but we just care about the action.
