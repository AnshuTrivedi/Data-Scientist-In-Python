1. Make directories
   > mkdir : an abbreviation of make directory
     eg-mkdir dir1
   > We can create more than one directory at once
   > mkdir dir1 dir2 dir3 .......

2. Remove directories
   > rmdir : an abbreviation of remove directory
     eg- rmdir dir1
   > We can remove more than one directory at once
   > rmdir dir1 dir2 dir3 ..........
   > Deleting empty directory may result in error due to hidden files 
   > rm -R dir , deletes directory
   > rm file   
   > rm -i file , interactive mode

3. Copying files
  > commnad format : cp source_files destination 
  > We should be careful when copying files, as cp will silently overwrite files with the same name.
  > To protect ourselves against this, we can enter the interactive mode of cp with the option -i
  > cp -i source-file destination , it asks Y and N for overwriting

4. Copying directories
  > we need to use the -R option with cp. The R stands for recursive, 
    as it will get into the directory's subdirectories, and into these subdirectories' subdirectories, and so on, copying everything.
  > cp -R source destination

5. Moving files and directories
  > mv source_dir destination_dir
