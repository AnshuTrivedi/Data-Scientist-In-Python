1. > Browse through directories using a file manager like Explorer in Windows, or Finder in OS X. 
     The framework that allows us to do that is called a filesystem.
   > When a directory isn't contained in any other directory, it is called a root.
   > when a directory contains another, we say that the latter is a subdirectory of the first, 
     and that the former is parent directory of the latter.
   > The current working directory ( or just working directory) is the directory where our terminal session is located
   > metadata is data about the file itself, not its contents. Examples of metadata are (the last) modification time and date of the file,
    its size, its name, and so on.

2. Inspecting directories
  > pwd : print working directory
  > ls : file list in directory
  > ls -p : This option signals what items are directories by appending a slash to the end of their names, 
            allowing us to tell directories from regular files apart.
  > ls -l : shows files metadata
  > ls -h :  h is for human readable and what it does is format the sizes in a more intelligible manner
 
3. Navigating file system
  > we don't have to type the whole path whenever we want to access a directory that is a child of the current working directory.
  > An absolute path is any path that starts with a slash (/). 
    Any other path is called a relative path, because they are paths relative to the current working directory.
  > Using ls -A files starts with '.' shows current directory and  .. parent direcory 
  > cd : change directory
  > cd. : current directory
  > cd.. : parent directory
  > cd ~ : home directory
  > cd - :back and forth btw directories
