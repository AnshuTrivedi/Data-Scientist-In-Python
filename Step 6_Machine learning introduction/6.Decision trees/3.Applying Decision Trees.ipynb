    "Over the past two missions, we learned about how decision trees are constructed. We used a modified version of ID3, which is a bit simpler than the most common tree building algorithms, [C4.5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C4.5_algorithm) and [CART](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictive_analytics#Classification_and_regression_trees). The basics are the same, however, so we can apply what we learned about how decision trees work to any tree construction algorithm."

If the models' predictions for the same row are far apart from each other, we have high variance. Imagine this time that we take a random sample of the training data and create many models. If the models' predictions for the same row are close together but far from the actual value, then we have high bias.\n",
