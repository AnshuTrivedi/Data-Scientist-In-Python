In other words, the tree will ideally split the labels into distinct groups with as little mixture possible. This'll allow the splits to give our tree more predictive power.`\n",

Although each individual decision tree in a random forest varies widely, the average of their predictions is less sensitive to the input data than a single tree is. This is because while one tree can construct an incorrect and overfit model, the average of 100 or more trees will be more likely to hone in on the signal and ignore the noise. The signal will be the same across all of the trees, whereas each tree will hone in on the noise differently. This means that the average will discard the noise and keep the signal."
