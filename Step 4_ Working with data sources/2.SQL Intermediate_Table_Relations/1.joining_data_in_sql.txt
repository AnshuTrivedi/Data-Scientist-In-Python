1.Introducing Joins
  > In the real world, it's much more common for databases to have data in more than one table. 
    If we want to be able to work with that data, we'll have to combine multiple tables within a query. 
    The way we do this in SQL is using joins. 
 > The most common way to join data using SQL is using an inner join. The syntax for an inner join is:
   SELECT [column_names] FROM [table_name_one]
   INNER JOIN [table_name_two] ON [join_constraint];
 >  eg- SELECT * FROM facts
        INNER JOIN cities ON cities.facts_id = facts.id
        LIMIT 5;

2.Understanding Inner Joins
  > An inner join works by including only rows from each table that have a match as specified using the ON clause
  > Our inner join will not include:
    Rows from the cities table that have a cities.facts_id that doesn't match any facts.id from facts.
    Rows from the facts table that have a facts.id that doesn't match any cities.facts_id from cities.

3.Practicing inner joins
  SELECT f.name country,c.name capital_city FROM facts f
  INNER JOIN cities c ON c.facts_id=f.id
  WHERE c.capital=1

4. Left Joins
  >  A left join includes all the rows that an inner join will select,
     plus any rows from the first (or left) table that don't have a match in the second table. 

    SELECT f.name country,f.population FROM facts f 
    LEFT JOIN cities c ON c.facts_id=f.id
    WHERE c.name IS NULL;

5.Right Joins and Outer Joins
  > It's important whenever you use inner joins to be mindful that you might be excluding important data, 
    especially if you are joining based on columns that aren't linked in the database schema.
  > There are two less-common join types SQLite does not support the first is a right join and another outer join
  > The main reason a right join would be used is when you are joining more than two tables.
    In these cases, using a right join is preferable because it can avoid restructuring your whole query to join one table.
    Outside of this, right joins are used reasonably rarely, so for simple joins it's better
    to use a left join than a right as it will be easier for your query to be read and understood by others.
