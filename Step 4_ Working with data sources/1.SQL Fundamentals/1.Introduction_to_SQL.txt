2. > Working with databases allows us to handle data on a greater scale and with greater security.
   > A database usually consists of multiple, related tables of data. Each table contains rows and columns, just like a CSV file.
   > SELECT: filters specific columns
   > WHERE : filters specific rows
  
3. Previewiing table using select

 >  SELECT *
   FROM table_name
   WHERE some_column> some_value AND some_column < some_value
   LIMIT something

  >If we wanted to specify a filter that meets either of the conditions instead, we would use the OR operator.
  SELECT *
   FROM table_name
   WHERE some_column> some_value OR (some_column < some_value AND other condition)
   LIMIT something

7. Ordering results by ORDER BY
  > SELECT *
