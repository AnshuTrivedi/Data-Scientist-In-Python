1.> Wecomputed summary statistics across columns with SQL. In many cases, though, 
   we want to drill down even more and compute summary statistics per group.   
 > The GROUP BY SQL statement allows us to compute summary statistics by "group," or unique value.
  
2. Quering virtual columns with HAVING
   > When we want to filter on a column generated by a GROUP BY query can't use WHERE clause, we can use the HAVING statement.
   > SELECT colname
     FROM tablename
     GROUP BY colname HAVING condition

 3.Rounding results with ROUND()
  >  ROUND(col_name,round_value)

4. Nesting functions
  > eg-ROUND(AVG(col_name1)/AVG(col_name2))

5. Casting
  > Cast(col_name as Float)

6.PRAGMA TABLE_INFO(table_name)
