1. To calculate the sum, average, min, or max of the results from queries
  > Aggregate functions are applied over columns of values and return a single value. MIN() and MAX(),for example, 
    calculate and return the minimum and maximum values in a column.
 
2. Calculate average and sum 
   > SELECT SUM(col_name)
     From table_name

   > SELECT AVG(col_name)
     From table_name
3. Total() used for float and int 
   SUM()   not used for float
   COUNT()  
 
4. Combine multiple aggregate functions
   SELECT MIN(col_name1),MAX(col_name2),SUM(col_name3)

5. Customizing rsults
  >  Use AS next to colunn name or function or skip it 
  > SELECT MAX(col_name) AS max_value     
  > SELECT MAX(col_name) max_value

6. Counting unqie values
  > SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(col_name)) distict_val
    FROM table_name

7. Performing arithmetic matics on SQL
  > SQL supports the standard arithmetic operators: *, +, -, and /, and we can use them like any other operator:
