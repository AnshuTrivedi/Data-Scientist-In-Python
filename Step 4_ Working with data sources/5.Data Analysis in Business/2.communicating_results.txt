   > Line and Functional organisation
   > We see that there's a large swath of people who we may need to communicate with. They will have varying degrees of data literacy,
     which makes it harder to not only report results, but also:
     Makes it harder for these colleagues to request things of you
     Makes it harder for you to manage a larged and varied influx of requests

2.  The scenario 
   making a rough analysis with some lax assumptions, instead of making a full-fledged analysis. Prototyping has several advantages:

   1) Having a prototype makes it much easier to estimate the cost of a fully fleshed-out project, be it human, technological, or
     financial resources.
   2) Having a more accurate estimate of the cost allows decision-makers to not go through with the project if it doesn't seem 
      profitable enough, or not the best allocation of resources at that point in time.
   3) It allows grunt workers (like ourselves) to change and add missing requirements to complete the project. Oftentimes these are overlooked and only spotted later; some examples are missing data, the creation of a new database, the development of an API.
   4) It allows business people (like the account manager) to tweak the project's goal.
   5) It gives all stakeholders an opportunity to add side-goals to the project that easily accomplishable given the main goal,
      thus maximizing the project's output.
   6) Despite the above, we should not only limit the scope of the project (focus on one goal) when prototyping, but we should also 
     timebox it — prototypes without deadlines run the danger of becoming time wasters that do not let us capitalize on the above advantages.
