1. Visualizing Distributions
  > To find patterns in a frequency table we have to look up the frequency of each unique value or class interval and
    at the same time compare the frequencies.
  > This process can get time consuming for tables with many unique values or class intervals, or when the frequency values are
    large and hard to compare against each other.
  > We can solve this problem by visualizing the data in the tables with the help of graphs. 
    Graphs make it much easier to scan and compare frequencies, providing us with a single picture of the entire distribution of a variable.
  > Because they are easy to grasp and also eye-catching, graphs are a better choice over frequency tables if we need to present 
    our findings to a non-technical audience.


2. Bar Plots
   > For variables measured on a nominal or an ordinal scale it's common to use a bar plot to visualize their distribution.
   > To generate a bar plot for the distribution of a variable we need two sets of values:
    1) One set containing the unique values.
    2) Another set containing the frequency for each unique value.
   > We can use Series.value_counts() to generate the table, and then use the Series.plot.bar() method on the resulting table
     to generate a bar plot.
   > To generate a horizontal bar plot, we can use the Series.plot.barh() method:

3. Horizontal Bar Plots
   > tick labels of the x-axis are hard to read in verical bar plots
   > To fix this we can rotate the labels, or we can switch to a horizontal bar plot.
   > We can rotate the labels using the rot parameter of Series.plot.bar(rot=value) method .
   > Series.plot.barh(title='')

4. Pie Charts
   > Another kind of graph we can use to visualize the distribution of nominal and ordinal variables is a pie chart.
   > We can generate pie charts using the Series.plot.pie() method.
   > The main advantage of pie charts over bar plots is that they provide a much better sense for the
     relative frequencies (proportions and percentages) in the distribution.  
   
5. Customizing a Pie Chart
   > To give a pie chart the right shape, we need to specify equal values for height and width in the figsize parameter of Series.plot.pie()
   > Series.value_counts().plot.pie(figsize = (6,6))
     plt.ylabel('') , it removes labels
   > Series.value_counts().plot.pie(figsize = (6,6), autopct = '%.1f%%') , autopct gives percenteges of wedges in pie chart
   
6. Histograms
   > For discrete varibales measured on ratio scales
   > Series.plot.hist()
   
7.  Statistic behind Histograms
   > Series.plot.hist(grid = True, xticks = arange(2,585,58.2), rot = 30) 
   > The distribution of values is uneven, with each class interval having a different frequency. 
     If the distribution was even, all the class intervals would have the same frequency.
     Most values (roughly three quarters) are clustered in the left half of the histogram.

8. Histograms as modified bar plots
   > Histogram is basically the visual form of a grouped frequency table
   > Structurally, a histogram can also be understood as a modified version of a bar plot.The main difference is that in the case of 
     a histogram there are no gaps between bars, and each bar represents an interval,not a single value.
   > The main reason we remove the gaps between bars in case of a histogram is that we want to show that the class intervals
     we plot are adjacent to one another.
   >  Scale of measurement        graph can be used to show distribution
        nominal                          bar plot, pie chart
        ordinal                          bar plot, pie chart
        interval                         histogram
        ratio                            histogram

9. Binning for Histograms
   > Series.plot.hist() splits a distribution by default into 10 class intervals
   > Choose bins to ensure good balance between information and comprehensibility.
   > Series.plot.hist(range = (start,end), bins = no_of_bins)

10. Skewed Distributions
    > In a skewed distribution:
      1) The values pile up toward the end or the starting point of the range, making up the body of the distribution.
      2) Then the values decrease in frequency toward the opposite end, forming the tail of the distribution.
    > If the tail points to the left, then the distribution is said to be left skewed. When it points to the left,
      the tail points at the same time in the direction of negative numbers, and for this reason the distribution is 
      sometimes also called negatively skewed.
    > If the tail points to the right, then the distribution is right skewed. The distribution is
     sometimes also said to be positively skewed because the tail points in the direction of positive numbers.

11. Symmetrical distributions
    > if the shape of the histogram is symmetrical, then we say that we have a symmetrical distribution.
    > A very common symmetrical distribution is one where the values pile up in the middle and gradually decrease in frequency
     toward both ends of the histogram. This pattern is specific to what we call a normal distribution (also called Gaussian distribution).
    > Another common symmetrical distribution is one where the values are distributed uniformly across the entire range.
     This pattern is specific to a uniform distribution.
