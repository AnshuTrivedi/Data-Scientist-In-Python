1. Variables in statistics
  > The properties with varying values we call variables
  > A row in data set describes the actual values that each variable takes for a given individual.

2. Quantitative and Qualitative variables
  > Variables in statistics can describe either quantities, or qualities.
  > how much there is of something describes a quantity, and, for this reason, it's called a quantitative variable.
  > Variables that describe qualities are called qualitative variables or categorical variables.
    Generally, qualitative variables describe what or how something is.
  >  Comparison btw quantitative and qualitative variables

3. Scales of Measurement
   > The amount of information a variable provides depends on its nature (whether it's quantitative or qualitative), 
     and on the way it's measured.
   > The system of rules that define how each variable is measured is called scale of measurement or, less often, level of measurement.
   > System of measurement made up of four different scales of measurement: nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio
   > characteristics of each scale pivot around three main questions:
     Can we tell whether two individuals are different?
     Can we tell the direction of the difference?
     Can we tell the size of the difference?

4. The Nominal Scale
   > For any variable measured on a nominal scale:
     We can tell whether two individuals are different      YES
     We can tell direction of difference                     NO
     We can tell size of difference                          NO
     We can measure quantitative variables                   NO
     We can measure qualtitative variables                   YES
 
5. The ordinal SClae
   > For any variable measured on a ordinal scale:
     We can tell whether two individuals are different      YES
     We can tell direction of difference                    YES
     We can tell size of difference                          NO
     We can measure quantitative variables                  YES
     We can measure qualtitative variables                   NO
  > The values of the variables measured on an ordinal scale can be both words and numbers.

6. The Interval and Ratio Scales
   > A variable measured on a scale that preserves the order between values and has well-defined intervals using real numbers is an example 
    of a variable measured either on an interval scale, or on a ratio scale.
   > For any variable measured on Interval or Ratio  scales:
     We can tell whether two individuals are different      YES
     We can tell direction of difference                    YES
     We can tell size of difference                         YES
     We can measure quantitative variables                  YES
     We can measure qualtitative variables                   NO

7. Difference btw Ratio and Interval SCales
   > What sets apart ratio scales from interval scales is the nature of the zero point.
   > On a ratio scale, the zero point means no quantity
   > On an interval scale, however, the zero point doesn't indicate the absence of a quantity. It actually indicates the presence of a quantity.
   > Another important difference between the two scales is given by the way we can measure the size of the differences.
     On a ratio scale, we can quantify the difference in two ways.
      One way is to measure a distance between any two points by simply subtracting one from another.
      The other way is to measure the difference in terms of ratios.
   > On an interval scale, however, we can measure meaningfully the difference between any two points only by finding the distance
     between them (by subtracting one point from another).
   >                                                     Interval             Ratio
      1)well defined intervals                             YES                  YES
      2)zero point indicates absense of quantity            NO                  YES
      3)difference measured in terms of distance            YES                 YES
      4) difference measured in terms of ratios             NO                  YES
    
8. Discrete and Continuous variables
   > Quantitative variables can be measured on ordinal, interval, or ratio scales.
   > Generally, if there's no possible intermediate value between any two adjacent values of a variable, we call that variable discrete.
   > Generally, if there's an infinity of values between any two values of a variable, we call that variable continuous.
   > Whether a variable is discrete or continuous is determined by the underlying nature of the variable being considered, 
     and not by the values obtained from the measurement.
   
9. Real limits
   > Generally, every value of a continuous variable is an interval, no matter how precise the value is. 
     The boundaries of an interval are sometimes called real limits. 
     The lower boundary of the interval is called lower real limit, and the upper boundary is called upper real limit.
