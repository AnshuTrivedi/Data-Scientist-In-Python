1. An Important difference
  > p(A|B)=card(A n B)/card(B)
  > p(A|B)=P(A n B)/p(B)
  > what's the difference between P(A|B) and P(A n B), if any?
  > P(A n B) means finding the probability that both A and B occur, while P(A|B) means finding only the probability 
    that A occurs (given that B occurs)
  > With P(A n B), we're trying to find the probability of two events (A and B), while with P(A|B) we're only trying 
    to find the probability of a single event, which is A.
  > P(A) means finding the probability of A
    P(A|B) means finding the conditional probability of A (given that B occurs)
    P(A n B) means finding the probability that both A and B occur
    P(A ? B) means finding the probability that A occurs or B occurs (this doesn't exclude the situation where both A and B occur)

2.  Complements
  > p(A|B) + P(Ac|B)=1 i.e event happen + event not happened=1(certain)

3. Order of Conoditioning
  > it matters how we condition — P(A|B) does not necessarily have the same value as P(B|A) 
    (although in some rare circumstances, they may end up being equal).
  
4. The Multiplication Rule
   > Either of the two formulas is belowl called the multiplication rule of probability — or, in short, the multiplication rule
    1) P(A n B)=p(B).p(A|B)
    2) P(A n B)=p(A).p(B|A)

5. Statistical Independence
   > In more general terms, if event A occurs and the probability of B remains unchanged and vice versa 
     (A and B can be any events for any random experiment), then events A and B are said to be statistically independent 
   > P(A n B)=p(B).P(A) where P(A) is equal to P(A|B)

6.  Statistical Dependence
    > p(A)=P(A|B)
      p(B)=P(B|A)
      P(A n B)=p(B).P(A)
   > If any of the three relationships above does not hold, then events A and B are said to be 
     statistically dependent (or just "dependent")

7. Independence for three events
   > So pairwise independence is the first condition that has to be respected if three events A, B, C are to be independent. 
       events A, B, C are independent in pairs — we say they are pairwise independent
      p(A n B)=P(A).P(B)
      P(A n C)=P(A).P(C)
      p(B n C)=P(B).P(C)

   > The second condition is that they should be also independent together, which mathematically means:
     If both conditions above hold, events A, B, C are said to be mutually independent. B
     p(A n B C)=p(A).P(B).(C)

8. Formula for three dependent events
   > Note that we can think of P(A n B n C) as the probability of two events instead of three and derive formula from it
   > P(A n B n C)=P(A).P(B|A).P(C|A n B)

In this mission, we continued learning about conditional probability and managed to cover important concepts and ideas:

We saw P(A n B) and P(A|B) mean different things.
We learned that  and .
We saw that the order of conditioning matters: P(A|B) is different than P(B|A).
We covered the multiplication rule for dependent and independent events (two or more events).
