1.Independence vs. Exclusivity
  > Both independence and exclusivity describe the relationship between two or more events, and we see that 
    they have different mathematical meanings:
    Independence= P(A n B) = P(A).P(B)
    Dependence  = P(A n B) = P(A).P(B|A)
    Exclusive   = P(A n B) = 0
  > If two events A and B are mutually exclusive, then it's impossible that they both occur, which means (A n B) 
    is an impossible event (and the probability of impossible events is always 0):
  >  two events A and B are independent if the occurrence of one doesn't change the probability of the other and 
     two events — A and B — are mutually exclusive if they cannot occur both at the same time.
  
2. Example Walkthrough
   > The person is infected with HIV and gets a positive result. 
    The person is not infected with HIV and gets a positive result.
    In the first scenario, note that two events happen: HIV and T+. In set notation, we write (HIV n T+) if both HIV and T+ occur.
    In the second scenario, two events happen: HIVC and T+. In set notation, we write (HIVC n T+) if both HIVC and T+ happen.
  > we can understand the event T+ as the union of the events (HIV n T+) and (HIVC n T+):
   T+=(HIV n T+)U(HIVC n T+) , The events (HIV n T+) and (HIVC and T+) are mutually exclusive (they cannot happen both at the same time), 
   because a person tested positive cannot both have and not have HIV. 
  > expand above as P(A+B)=P(A)+P(B)
   P(T+)=P(HIV n T+)+P(HIVC n T+) : P(HIV)*P(T+|HIV)+P(HIVC)*P(T+|HIVC)

3. A General Formula
  > The events HIV and HIVC are mutually exclusive and exhaustive. 
    If two events are exhaustive, it means they make up the whole sample space .
  > P(A)=P(B n A) + P(Bc n A)
    p(A)=P(B)*P(A/B) + P(Bc)*P(A|Bc)

4.  Formula for three events
   > we have events A, B1, B2, and B3
   > P(A)=P(B1 n A) + P(B2 n A) +P(B3 n A)
     p(A)=P(B1)*P(B1|A)+ P(B2)*P(B2|A) + P(B3)*P(B3|A)
   eg- p(delay)=P(boing)*P(delay|boing)+P(airbus)*P(delay|airbus)+ P(erj)*P(delay|erj)


5. Law of total Probability
  > let's say the sample space  is made up of n mutually exclusive and exhaustive events:
    P(A)=P(B1)*P(A|B1) +P(B2)*P(A|B2) + P(B3)*P(A|B3) + .............+ P(Bn)*P(A|Bn)
 > The above formula is called the law of total probability.
    The law of total probability is often rewritten using the summation sign :
    P(A)= i=1 to n P(Bi)*P(A|Bi)

6. Bayes' Theorem
   > P(B|A)=P(B n A)/P(A) where p(A) is calculated by Law of total probability
   > Conditional Probability : P(B|A)=P(B n A)/P(A)
     Law of total Probability :  P(A)=P(B1)*P(A|B1) +P(B2)*P(A|B2) + P(B3)*P(A|B3) + .............+ P(Bn)*P(A|Bn)
     Bayes' Theorem : P(B|A)= P(B n A)/P(B1)*P(A|B1) +P(B2)*P(A|B2) + P(B3)*P(A|B3) + .............+ P(Bn)*P(A|Bn)
   eg- P(boing|delay)=? ,what is probability of boing given it is delayed
   

7. Prior and Posterior Probability
   > Before doing any test: P(HIV)
    After testing positive: P(HIV|T+)
   > The probability of being infected with HIV before doing any test is called the prior probability ("prior" means "before"). 
     The probability of being infected with HIV after testing positive is called the posterior probability ("posterior" means "after").
