1. Introduction
   > We learned that the mean takes into account each value in the distribution, and we saw that it's fairly easy to define the 
     mean algebraically.These two properties make the mean far superior to the median
   > The median comes in handy, however, when it's not possible or appropriate to compute the mean.
   > In this mission we'll explore a couple of cases where neither the mean nor the median are suitable for finding an average value

2. Mode for ordinal Variables
   > However, if the two middle values were ['Gtl', 'Mod'], then it wouldn't be clear at all what to choose for the median. In cases like this, 
     one workaround for finding an average value is to measure the most frequent value in the distribution.

3. Mode for nominal variables
   >  we made the case that we could compute the mean for ordinal variables if the values are numbers. This reasoning doesn't
     extend to nominal variables because they don't describe quantities, like ordinal variables do.
   
4. Mode for discrete variables
   > The mean and the median generally summarize the distribution of a discrete variable much better than the mode, 
    and you should use the mode only if you need to communicate your results to a non-technical audience.

5. Special Cases
   > There are distributions that can have more than one mode. 
   > unimodal,bimodal,multimodal
   > We can also have cases when there is no mode at all.
      there's no value (or values) that occurs more often than others. For this reason, this distribution doesn't have a mode.
   > Distributions without a mode are often specific to continuous variables.
     It's quite rare to find two identical values in a continuous distribution (especially if we have decimal numbers),
     so the frequency of each unique value is usually 1. Even if we find identical values, their frequency is very likely 
      to be too low to produce a meaningful mode value.

   > The workaround is to organize the continuous variable in a grouped frequency table, and select for the mode the midpoint of 
     the class interval (the bin) with the highest frequency.

6. Skewed Distributions
   > When we plot a histogram or a kernel density plot to visualize the shape of a distribution,
     the mode will always be the peak of the distribution.
   > So in a right-skewed distribution, the mean will usually be to the right of the median, and the median will be to the right of the mode.
   > For a left-skewed distribution, the direction is simply reversed: the mean is positioned to the left of the median,
     and the median to the left of the mode.

7.  SymmetricaL distributions
   > The median divides the distribution in two equal halves. As a consequence, the median will always be at the center of a
     perfectly symmetrical distribution because only a line drawn at the center can divide the distribution in two equal halves.
   > The mean and the median are always equal for any perfectly symmetrical distribution.
   > Although the mean and the median have a constant location for every symmetrical distribution (no matter the shape), 
    the location of the mode can change. The mode is where the peak is, so for a normal distribution the mode will be at the center, 
    right where the mean and the median are.
   > It's possible to have a symmetrical distribution with more than one peak, which means that the mode won't be at the center
   > A uniform distribution doesn't have any peaks, which means it doesn't have any mode

  In this mission, we learned that the mode is ideal for summarizing:
   Ordinal data represented using words.
   Nominal data.
   Discrete data (when the average value needs to be communicated to a non-technical audience).
