This helps us reduce the potential bias that is introduced when participants know which pill they were given. For example, participants who are aware they were given the weight loss pill may try to add healthier foods to their diet to help them lose more weight. Both groups were weighed before the study began and a month later, after the study ended.\n",

Experimental studies usually involve bringing in participants, instructing them to perform some tasks, and observing them. A key part of running an experimental study is random assignment, which involves assigning participants in the study to random groups without revealing which group each participant is in`. Before exploring and analyzing a dataset, it's important to understand how the study was conducted. Flaws in how the study was run can lead you to reach the wrong conclusions.`"
