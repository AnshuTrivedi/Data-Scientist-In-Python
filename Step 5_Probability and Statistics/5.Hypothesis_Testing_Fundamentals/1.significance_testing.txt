1. Hypothesis testing
  > A hypothesis is a pattern or rule about a process in the world that can be tested. 
    We use hypothesis testing to determine if a change we made had a meaningful impact or not.
  > ou can use hypothesis testing to help you determine:
     if a new banner ad on a website caused a meaningful drop in the user engagement,
     if raising the price of a product caused a meaningful drop in sales,
     if a new weight loss pill helped people lose more weight.
  > Hypothesis testing allows us to calculate the probability that random chance was actually responsible for the difference in outcome.
  > Every process has some inherent amount of randomness that we can't measure and understanding the role of chance helps 
     us reach a conclusion that's more likely to be correct. 
  > We first set up a null hypothesis that describes the status quo. We then state an alternative hypothesis, 
    which we used to compare with the null hypothesis to decide which describes the data better. In the end, we either need to:
    1) reject the null hypothesis
    2) fail to reject the null hypothesis
   

2. Research Design
   > Before exploring and analyzing a dataset, it's important to understand how the study was conducted. 
     Flaws in how the study was run can lead you to reach the wrong conclusions.
   > Understanding the research design for a study is an important first step that informs the rest of your analysis.
     It helps us uncover potential flaws in the study that we need to keep in mind as we dive deeper
   > A key part of running an experimental study is random assignment, which involves assigning participants 
     in the study to random groups without revealing which group each participant is in.

3. Statistical significance
   > Statistics helps us determine if the difference in the weight lost between the 2 groups is because of random chance or
    because of an actual difference in the outcomes. If there is a meaningful difference, we say that the results are
    statistically significant.
   
4. Test Statistic
  > To decide which hypothesis more accurately describes the data, we need to frame the hypotheses more quantitatively. 
    The first step is to decide on a test statistic, which is a numerical value that summarizes the data and we can use in 
    statistical formulas. We use this test statistic to run a statistical test that will determine how likely the difference
    between the groups were due to random chance.
  
5. Perrmutation test
   > The permutation test is a statistical test that involves simulating rerunning the study many times and 
     recalculating the test statistic for each iteration. 
   > The goal is to calculate a distribution of the test statistics over these many iterations. This distribution is called 
    the sampling distribution and it approximates the full range of possible test statistics under the null hypothesis.
