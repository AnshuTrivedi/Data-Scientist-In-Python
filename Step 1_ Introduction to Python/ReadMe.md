# Note:
 I have mentioned link of jupyter notebook files of course parts mentioned as 1,2,3 and so on.All below mentioned course parts also have</br>
 very short notes in pdf format starting with same name as jupyter notebook.So , if interested to see</br> 
 pdf takeaways ,kindly go to folders.</br>
